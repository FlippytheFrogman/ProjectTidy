In order to understand that data set that I have created, I felt it was important to start with the following original overview. I have add text following it that explains the tidy data set.

From the original documentation (in the zip file)

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals. These time domain signals were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals . Also, the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm. 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals.
 
These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern.

Here are the steps that were followed to create the output tidy data set.

1    Merged the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2    Extracted the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3    Used descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4    Provided descriptive variable names. 
5    Created a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and  subject.  This was done by taking the mean of the sample data provided.
More information is available in the "README.md" file.

The following describes the transformed data.
