==================================================================

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. 
Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) 
wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. 

Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, data was captured 
The obtained datasets were originally andomly partitioned into two sets, 
where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

This output here is recombined into one data set and then averaged by subject and activity

In order to process the original data provided execute run_analysis.R.
